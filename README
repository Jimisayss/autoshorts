# AutoShorts 🐾🎬

**Hands-free YouTube Shorts. Built because my dogs pin me down and I love it.**

---

## 🧠 Overview

AutoShorts is a Chrome extension that **automatically skips to the next YouTube Short** as soon as the current one finishes, while **tracking how many you’ve watched** and **how much time you’ve spent** watching.

> My dogs love to chill on my lap while I’m at my desk.  
> That means I can’t scroll with a mouse or tap the keyboard.  
> So I made something that scrolls for me. And now — maybe for you too.

## 💖 Support

If this saved your hands, made your day smoother, or let your dog nap a little longer — consider buying me a coffee:

No pressure. But support like yours helps me keep building weird, useful, human-centered tools like this.

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- [ ] Toggle to pause/resume auto-skip  
- [ ] Optional sounds or alerts  
- [ ] Better stats visualization  
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts  
- [ ] Experimental: "snore detection" for skip timing (kidding... kinda)

---

## 🐞 Known Issues

- **Multi-monitor support is inconsistent:** AutoShorts may not always work as expected when Chrome is moved between monitors with different scaling or DPI settings.
- **YouTube tab focus required:** The extension only works reliably when the YouTube Shorts tab is focused. If the tab is not active, auto-skip and stats tracking may not function.
