# AutoShorts 🐾🎬

**Hands-free YouTube Shorts. Built because my dogs pin me down — and I love it.**

## 🧠 What is AutoShorts?

AutoShorts is a Chrome extension that **automatically skips to the next YouTube Short** as soon as the current one finishes, while **tracking how many you’ve watched** and **how much time you’ve spent** watching.

It was built out of necessity:  
> My dogs love to chill on my lap while I’m at my desk.  
> That means I can’t scroll with a mouse or tap the keyboard.  
> So I made something that scrolls for me. And now — maybe for you too.

No pressure. But support like yours helps me keep building weird, useful, human-centered tools like this.
